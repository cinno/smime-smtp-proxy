================

About
-----

The smime-smtp-proxy is a small daemon that accepts SMTP connections,
accepts incoming mail, digitally signs it using an S/MIME key and
certificate and forwards it to another SMTP server.

Warning
-------

Please be aware of the security implications of an signing SMTP proxy:

 * Make sure to not create an open relay if the machine is reachable from
   the internet.
 * Make sure the signing key on the host and the host itself is secured
   appropriately.
 * Make sure that automatic mail signatures are what you need.

Installation and setup
----------------------

Please install this software using the packages provided by your
distribution. If you read this file in /usr/share/doc/smime-smtp-proxy/,
then you already have installed the package properly.

The configuration requires changing two files:

 * /etc/smime-smtp-proxy/proxsmtp.conf
   This file is a proxsmtp configuraiton file. For a detailed description
   of the configuratoin parameters, see the manpage proxsmtpd.conf(5).
   You do not need to change the FilterType and FilterCommand parameters.
  
   For a quick start:
    + set the OutAddress to the IP adress and port of the server the mail
      should be forwarded to.
    + adjust the Listen parameter if you only want to receive mail at a
      specific IP address, or change the port it should listen on.

 * /etc/smime-smtp-proxy/key.pem
   This file contains the key and certificate you want to use, in .pem
   format. The program ships with a dummy file that should not be used in a
   productive server.
  
   This file should be made read-only by the user root if unpriviliged
   users have access to the machine.
